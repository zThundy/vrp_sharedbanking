# vrp_sharedbanking
A new banking and robbery system for fivem created on DunkoVRP

# Features

- There are 3 bank typed: 1, witch is Fleeca, 2, witch is Pacific Standard, 3, witch is Blaine County
- When you start a robbery in that bank, the script select all users with the account registered on the robbed bank, then take 5% of money from those users, and then give the money to the player.

# Suggestions

- I suggest to put an if inside the atms to let players only take like 500$ for operation, to let the players go to their own bank to deposit or withdraw large quantity of money
